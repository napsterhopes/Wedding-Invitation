### Wedding Hall + Catering
A wedding in a standalone banquet hall without catering services falls under the category of “Renting of immovable property for commercial purposes” under HSN Code 9972 and attracts 18% GST. This is because renting a banquet hall is considered a service under GST law, and since it is not a residential property, the applicable tax rate is 18%.

A wedding in a standalone banquet hall with catering services taxed at 5% GST would fall under the category of “Outdoor Catering Services” under HSN Code 9963.
